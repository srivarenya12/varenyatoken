# Varenya Token

## Description

This Solidity program implements the Varenya token, an ERC20-compatible token named "Varenyatoken" with symbol "VT". The token contract includes functionalities for minting tokens, burning tokens, and transferring tokens. Additionally, it incorporates a modifier to restrict certain functions to be accessible only by the owner of the contract.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with this token contract, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., VarenyaToken.sol).
3. Copy and paste the provided Solidity code for the Varenya token contract into the file.
4. Make sure you have selected the appropriate compiler version (e.g., pragma solidity ^0.8.20;).
5. Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar, then click on the "Compile VarenyaToken.sol" button.
6. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "VarenyaToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
7. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling its functions such as mint, burn, and transfer.
